# Agile Artifact 3

**Sprint Backlog**

1. Model Development

- [] Implement baseline classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- [] Split data using TimeSeriesSplit for validation
- [] Evaluate models using ROC AUC and other metrics
- [] Visualize ROC curves for model comparison
- [] Choose 1 model, providing reasoning
  - [] Baseline Submission
- [] Hyperparameter optimization
- [] Final model training & fitting
- [] Submission

**Increment**

1. Establish a robust baseline for model performance using multiple classifiers.
2. Develop a reproducible workflow for model training, validation, and evaluation.
