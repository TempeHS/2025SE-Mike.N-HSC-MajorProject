# Agile Artifact 1

**Sprint Backlog**

1. Initial data exploration

- [x] Load dataset and examine the structure
- [x] Check for missing values
- [x] Map site_ids to website urls
- [x] Visualize the distribution of site_ids, timestamps and session durations
- [x] Visualize class balance

2. Alice vs. Intruder data exploration

- [x] Create temporal features
- [x] Create session features
- [x] Analyse Alice's vs Intruder's temporal patterns (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)
- [x] Analyse Alice's vs Intruder's session patterns (number of unique sites, top visited sites, repeated site visits, etc.)

**Increment**

1. Potential features to be created based on temporal patterns and session patterns.
2. An intuition of Alice's behaviours vs. Intruder's behaviours.

**Sprint Review**

The sprint achieved its goals of extracting insights from the dataset, translating initial sequence patterns to categorical and numerical features for exploratory analysis. While some visualizations highlighted the differences in the behavioural pattern of Alice and Intruder, others show no such discrepancies. The insights gain in this sprint will be harnessed for feature selection, feautre engineering and other preprocessing measures in the next phase.
